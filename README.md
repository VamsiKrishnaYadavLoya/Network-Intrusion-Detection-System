# Network-Intrusion-Detection-System
I have created a Machine Learning Model to monitor the network for any cyber-attack.
Skills required : Python, Machine Learning, HTML, CSS, React.js, Flask, Docker.
I have provided the complete source code with all the necessary files required.

Here are the steps to RUN the project:

1. Bbefore running the project install all the requirements in the req.txt using command "pip install -r req.txt".
2. Run vamsi.py which will create a file called model.pkl (pickle file which contains trained model).
3. Run app.py will integrate the frontend html file (In the Templates Folder) with model.pkl using Flask app.
4. Containerized it using docker anf hosted it in Azure.
